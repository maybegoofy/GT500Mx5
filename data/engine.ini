[ENGINE_DATA]
ALTITUDE_SENSITIVITY=0.1		; sensitivity to altitude
INERTIA=0.130					; engine inertia

LIMITER_HZ=30

[COAST_REF]
RPM=6800						; rev number reference
TORQUE=90						; engine braking torque value in Nm at rev number reference

[TURBO_0]
LAG_DN=0.996      ; Interpolation lag used slowing down the turbo
LAG_UP=0.9956     ; Interpolation lag used to spin up the turbo
MAX_BOOST=2.85      ; Maximum boost generated. This value is never exceeded and multiply the torque like T=T*(1.0 + boost), so a boost of 2 will give you 3 times the torque at a given rpm.
WASTEGATE=2.85    ; Max level of boost before the wastegate does its things. 0 = no wastegate
DISPLAY_MAX_BOOST=2.85   ; Value used by display apps
REFERENCE_RPM=5000    ; The reference rpm where the turbo reaches maximum boost (at max gas pedal). 
GAMMA=3.5    ; Turbo pressure sensitivity on accelerator pedal
COCKPIT_ADJUSTABLE=0    ; cockpit adjustable turbo pressure

[DAMAGE]
TURBO_BOOST_THRESHOLD=5  ; level of TOTAL boost before the engine starts to take damage
TURBO_DAMAGE_K=5			; amount of damage per second per (boost - threshold)
RPM_THRESHOLD=7000			; RPM at which the engine starts to take damage
RPM_DAMAGE_K=1			; amount of damage per second per (rpm-threshold)
