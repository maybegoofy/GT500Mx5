[DATA]
MAX_TORQUE=3500			        ; Increased Maximum Brake torque in Nm for better stopping power
FRONT_SHARE=0.58			; Adjusted Percentance of brake torque at front axis for optimized braking balance
HANDBRAKE_TORQUE=100			; Handbrake torque (at the rear wheels) enhanced for better control in drifting scenarios
COCKPIT_ADJUSTABLE=1                    ; 0: no bias control from cockpit, 1: bias control from cockpit
ADJUST_STEP=0.3                         ; Finer step for bias cockpit adjustment for more precise control.

DISC_LR=BDisk_LR_ObjOff
DISC_RR=BDisk_RR_ObjOff
FRONT_MAX_GLOW=80                       ; Increased glow effect on front discs to reflect higher braking temperatures
REAR_MAX_GLOW=30                        ; Slightly increased glow effect on rear discs
LAG_HOT=0.990                           ; Adjusted lag for faster response when discs are hot
LAG_COOL=0.975                          ; Faster cooling rate to handle the increased heat from more aggressive braking
